WIP

Hey, I'm Roderick Hossack. I'm a software engineer focused on backend work using C++ or whichever technology my current task calls for.

## About Me

I've worked in the healthcare, simulation, game development and publishing, cloud technology, and additive manufacturing industries. Like in Dark Souls II, I take advantage of my adaptability.

I originally became a software engineer in order to make video games and hold a Bachelor's degree in Game & Simulation Programming. Part of how my work brings people joy even outside of game development is that I try to provide a positive experience for anyone impacted by my code, whether they're users or fellow developers.

## Technical Skills

- Languages: C++ (5 years), C# (2 years), Ruby (3 years), Python (1 year), UE Blueprints
(2 years), GDScript (2 years)
- Frameworks: Ruby on Rails (2 years), Azure Service Fabric (1 year)
- Tools & Platforms: Unreal Engine, GitHub, Azure DevOps, JIRA
