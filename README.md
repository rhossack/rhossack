Hey, I'm Roderick Hossack. I'm a software engineer focused on backend work using C++ or whichever technology my current task calls for.

## About Me

I've worked in the healthcare, simulation, game development and publishing, cloud technology, and additive manufacturing industries. Like in Dark Souls II, I take advantage of my adaptability.

I originally became a software engineer in order to make video games and hold a Bachelor's degree in Game & Simulation Programming. Part of how my work brings people joy even outside of game development is that I try to provide a positive experience for anyone impacted by my code, whether they're users or fellow developers.
